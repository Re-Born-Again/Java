# Java

Welcome to the Java Programming Examples repository! 
This project contains a collection of Java programs covering a wide range of topics, including collections, the Executor framework, interfaces, streams, threads, and more. 
This repository offers practical examples and demonstrations.

## Features
  - Collections:

    - Lists: ArrayList, LinkedList, and their operations.
    - Maps: Understand HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.
    - Queues: PriorityQueue, LinkedList, and other queue implementations.

  - Generics: Examples demonstrating the use of generics in Java.
    
  - Lambda Functions: Practical uses and examples of lambda expressions.
         
  - Interfaces:
    
    - Functional Interfaces: Examples of BinaryOperator, Consumer, Function, Predicate, Supplier, and UnaryOperator.
        
         
  - Threads:
    
    - Thread Management: Creating, synchronizing, and managing threads.
    - Concurrency: Using concurrent collections and handling thread confinement.
         

  - Executor Framework:
    
    - Callables & Futures: Managing asynchronous tasks and handling results.
    - Completable Futures: Combining and composing asynchronous tasks.
    - Executors: Managing and controlling thread pools.
    - Asynchronous API: Handling asynchronous computations and exceptions.
   
  - Streams:
    
    - Stream Operations: Creation, filtering, mapping, grouping, and more.
