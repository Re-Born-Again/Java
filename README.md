  - Executor Framework:
       - Callables & Futures: Managing asynchronous tasks and handling results.
       - Completable Futures: Combining and composing asynchronous tasks.
       - Executors: Managing and controlling thread pools.
       - Asynchronous API: Handling asynchronous computations and exceptions.
  - Interfaces:
       - Functional Interfaces: Examples of BinaryOperator, Consumer, Function, Predicate, Supplier, and UnaryOperator.
  - Streams:
       - Stream Operations: Creation, filtering, mapping, grouping, and more.
  - Threads:
       - Thread Management: Creating, synchronizing, and managing threads.
       - Concurrency: Using concurrent collections and handling thread confinement.
  - Generics: Examples demonstrating the use of generics in Java.
  - Lambda Functions: Practical uses and examples of lambda expressions.
  - Linked Lists: Implementations and operations on linked lists.
