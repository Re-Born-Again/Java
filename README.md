# Java

Welcome to the Java repository! 
This project contains a collection of Java programs covering a wide range of topics, including collections, the Executor framework, interfaces, streams, threads, and more. 
This repository offers practical examples and demonstrations.

## Generics:

Java Generics allows type-safe operations by enabling classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on types specified at runtime. This section covers examples of how generics provide flexibility and type safety in your code.

## Lambda Functions:

This section covers Lambda Expressions in Java, which enable you to treat functionality as a method argument or store it in a variable. Lambdas simplify the code and make it more readable, especially when used with the Streams API.

## Collections:

This section covers the use of Java’s Collection Framework, which provides a unified architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects. Code examples include the use of:

  - List: Ordered collections that allow duplicate elements.
  - Map: Key-value pairs where keys are unique.
  - Queue: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure.
  - Set: Collections that do not allow duplicate elements.

## Interfaces:

This section showcases examples of Java Functional Interfaces that support functional programming using lambda expressions and method references. Covered interfaces include:

  - BinaryOperator
  - Consumer
  - Function
  - Predicate
  - Supplier
  - UnaryOperator

## Threads:

The Threads section explores Java’s thread management and concurrent programming. It includes topics such as:

  - Creating and managing threads.
  - Synchronization and locking mechanisms.
  - Thread-safe collections and atomic objects.
  - Thread confinement, signalling, and volatile variables.

## Executive Framework:

The Executive Framework demonstrates multithreading and concurrency control in Java using advanced concepts:

  - Callables and Futures: Managing tasks that return results.
  - Completable Futures: Handling asynchronous programming with promises.
  - Executors: A higher-level replacement for working directly with threads.
  - Asynchronous API: Performing non-blocking operations.
  - Handling Exceptions: Gracefully managing exceptions in concurrent execution.

## Streams:

The Streams API provides a powerful way to process sequences of data in a functional style. This section includes code on:

  - Creating streams from different data sources.
  - Filtering, mapping, and sorting streams.
  - Reducing and collecting stream data.
  - Grouping and partitioning stream elements.
